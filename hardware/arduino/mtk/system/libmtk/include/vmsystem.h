 * FUNCTION

 * DESCRIPTION
 *  For application update.
 *  A LinkIt application may call this function to quit and update itself by
 *  assiging path to the new VXP executable. The framework would verify the
 *  integrity of the new VXP executable, and update the executable.
 *
 *  While the SDK does not provide facility to encrypt the VXP binary,
 *  3rd party software may be used to encrypt the binary with
 *  supported encryption method. This method is defined by the VM_PMNG_ENCRYPTION.
 *  In this version of SDK only DES encryption is supported.
 *
 *  If update succeeded, the new VXP executable replaces the original executable
 *  and launches.
 *
 *  If update failed, the original VXP executable is launched again,
 *  and a system message VM_MSG_UPDATE_FAIL is sent with the parameter
 *  VM_PMNG_UPDATE_RESULT.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *  filename:   [IN] The full path to the new application executable.
 *  key:        [IN] The key to decrypt the executable.
 *                   Pass NULL if the new app have no encryption.
 *  key_length: [IN] Length of key, Pass 0 if there is no ecryption.
 *  encryption: [IN] encryption method, see VM_PMNG_ENCRYPTION.
 *                   Note that key must be NULL and key_length must be 0 if
 *                   encryption is set to VM_PMNG_ENCRYPTION_NONE, otherwise
 *                   VM_PMNG_UPDATE_ERROR_MISSING_ENCRYTION_METHOD may return.
 *                   Currently, only DES encryption is supported, and developers
 *                   should avoid padding during DES encryption. The file size
 *                   of the encrypted executable must be the same as the
 *                   un-encrypted executable, otherwise the application may
 *                   fail to update.
 * RETURNS
